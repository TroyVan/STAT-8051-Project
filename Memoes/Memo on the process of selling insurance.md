# Customer requests quotes from insurance companies

When a customer decides to buy insurance, they will decide what kind of coverage, and what amount of coverage, they will need. In the auto insurance realms, vehiche owners are required to carry 3rd-party liability coverage (paying for the damage you cause to others' vehicle, property, persons, etc.), but may additionally buy accident coverage (paying for the damage you cause to your own car), theft and/or casualty coverage, etc. Additionally, they will decide on a policy maximum (the maximum amount of money the insurance company will pay out - if that is not enough to cover the damages, you pay the rest out of your own pocket) and a deductible (the first $x you will pay out of pocket before the insurance pays out anything). For example, a higher maximum may be desired if the customer drives an expensive car, or is not confident of their driving skills and expects a high likelihood of accident.

The customer then will ask around for quotes - how much money each insurance company will sell the desired insurance for.

# Customer submits requested information

To build a quote, insurance companies will ask for information about the driver(s) and the vehicle(s). Different companies may ask for different things. 

# Companies build risk profiles

The information collected is used to build a risk profile: that is, how much money an insurance company can expect to pay out on this policy. It can be thought of as a random variable: Y is the amount of money that will be paid out for covered damages on the policy, and the company estimates the distribution of Y with the information it collects. For example, we may expect a policy to pay out more if:
- the driver is in a demographic group (age, sex, etc.) known to drive less carefully than others
- the vehicle is expensive
- the customer lives in an area more prone to accidents or natural disasters
- the customer requests more types of coverage
- the customer requests a high maximum

# Companies produce quotes

Now the insurance company will decide how much to charge for a policy. It should balance:
- how much it expects to pay out on this policy
- the desire to maximize profit
- the customer's ability and willingness to pay (the customer may decide not to buy if the price is too much, though it is unlikely that one will buy no auto insurance at all since it is required by law)
- the competition (what price other companies will offer, considering that they will do the same kind of considerations, albeit with different risk assessments)

Then the company will produce a quote. A quote is an offer to sell the requested policy at a specified price.

# Customer compares offers and make a purchase

Upon receiving quotes from insurance companies, the customer will compare quotes and pick one to buy. The customer may consider, among other things:
- the prices
- quality of customer service, considering reputation, ease of communication and claim process, prior experience, etc.
- brand loyalty (one may choose to stick with the same company they have a policy from in prior years, all things equal)
